The thing, the myth, the legend. BigFoot sightings have been reported for generations, and stories of BigFoot persist in modern times. But who believes in BigFoot? (And why?)

The goal of this Data Analytics team is to dive into where people claim to see BigFoot and what their environmental conditions looked like during the reported sighting. We will explore multiple factors including:

What do the weather conditions look like during the sighting? 
Are sightings more common at a particular time of day? Is BigFoot a morning foot or a night owl? 
Are sightings more common during a particular month or year? When does BigFoot hibernate? 
What is the recurrence of sightings by state/location? What state had the most/least occurrences? Where does BigFoot like to spend the Christmas holidays?
How many sightings are firsthand? How many are thirdhand? How do first/second sights relate to other criteria in the dataset?
